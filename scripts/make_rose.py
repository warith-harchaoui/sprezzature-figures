make_rose — a house-styled Nightingale rose (coxcomb / polar-area chart) as a hand-authored SVG.

A rose diagram — Florence Nightingale's *coxcomb*, also called a
polar-area chart — is a pie chart's honest cousin. Every wedge spans
the **same angle** (here one twelfth of the circle, one per month), so
the eye is not fooled by fat slices; the story lives entirely in each
wedge's **radius**, which grows with the value. Nightingale used it in
1858 to argue that most soldiers in the Crimean War died not on the
battlefield but from preventable disease in filthy hospitals, and the
sheer size of the disease petals won the argument that a table never
could.

This module rebuilds that argument in the sprezzature-* house style. Twelve
monthly wedges are stacked by cause of death — preventable disease,
wounds, and everything else — so each petal's total radius is the
month's death rate and its coloured bands show what the men were dying
of. The reader sees at a glance that the pale-blue disease band swamps
the red wounds band, and that the whole rose shrinks dramatically once
Nightingale's sanitary commission arrives.

The SVG is built by hand — no matplotlib / seaborn / plotly, and no
Vega, because equal-angle annular sectors keyed to a calendar are not a
native Vega-Lite mark and read far more cleanly authored directly. It
follows the tokens from :mod:`_style`: the Apple-ish palette, Roboto
typography, ink ``#1D1D1F`` on a white ground, rounded joins, a
takeaway title and a one-line subtitle.

The figure is interactive without any JavaScript: hovering or
keyboard-focusing a legend entry or any wedge of a cause dims the other
causes so that one band stands out across every month, and each wedge
carries a native ``<title>`` tooltip with the exact death rate. Motion
is guarded by ``prefers-reduced-motion``.

The data is Nightingale's own, transcribed from her 1858 diagram:
annual mortality rate per 1,000 men, by cause, April 1854 through
March 1855 (the first, deadliest year of the two she charted).

Running the module writes the SVG artifact to
``sprezzature-figures/assets/svg-examples/rose.svg``.
