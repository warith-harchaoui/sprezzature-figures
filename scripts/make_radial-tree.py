make_radial-tree — publication-quality radial tree as a hand-authored SVG.

A **radial tree** lays a strict parent → child hierarchy out around a
circle: the root sits at the centre, and every generation is pushed onto
a concentric ring further out, with the angular span of the canvas split
among the leaves. Reading it, depth becomes *radius* (distance from the
centre) and sibling order becomes *angle*, so a wide, shallow taxonomy
fills the frame far more compactly than the left-to-right tidy tree in
``make_tree.py`` — the same reason a sunburst beats an indented list when
the branching factor is high. Links are **curved** (they bow along the
arc between two rings) rather than drawn as straight spokes, which keeps
sibling bundles visually separate and reads as an organic "branching"
shape instead of a wheel of radii.

Vega-Lite has no native tree/radial-tree mark (the layout is a recursive
angular assignment, not a data-to-mark mapping), so this figure is built
as an SVG string by hand rather than through ``vl_convert``. The layout
is the classic radial Reingold–Tilford variant:

* a post-order pass gives every **leaf** the next free slice of the
  angular range; each internal node is centred on the angular span of
  its children — the tidy-tree rule, expressed in angle instead of row;
* **depth** fixes the radius: ring 0 is the centre, and each deeper
  generation sits on a wider concentric ring;
* **links** are cubic Béziers whose control points are pulled toward the
  parent's ring, so each link bows outward along the arc — the smooth
  "radial diagonal" that professional dendrogram / phylogeny tools draw.

This is a **static** figure. A radial tree communicates its whole shape
in a single glance — a grow-in reveal adds no insight a still cannot
carry, and (worse) would leave the gallery's first frame empty — so
every mark is drawn once, fully, in its final state. The one piece of
motion that *does* pay for itself is interaction, and it stays
CSS-only (no JavaScript): every node carries a native ``<title>``
tooltip, and a ``:hover`` / ``:focus`` rule dims the rest of the tree
while lifting the hovered branch, so any wedge can be isolated on top of
an already-complete picture. ``interactive`` is true; ``animated`` is
false.

House style follows ``_style.py`` / ``bar.vl.json``: Roboto type, the
Apple-system categorical palette, ink ``#1D1D1F`` on white, rounded
node dots, a start-anchored title plus a one-line takeaway subtitle.
Each top-level branch owns a hue that tints its whole subtree, so the
eye can group a family at a glance. Leaf labels are side-aware (right
half anchors start, left half anchors end) at a constant radial gap,
each with a thin leader out to the node, so the ring of text reads
cleanly and never crosses a branch.

Running the module writes the SVG to
``sprezzature-figures/assets/svg-examples/radial-tree.svg``.
