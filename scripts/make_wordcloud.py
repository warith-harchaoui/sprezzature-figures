make_wordcloud — a house-styled word cloud (spiral-packed) as a hand-authored SVG.

A word cloud answers one question at a glance: *which words dominate a
body of text, and how do they group*. Here the text is a year of
product reviews for a mid-range coffee grinder; each word is sized by
how often reviewers used it and tagged by the theme it belongs to. The
theme reads two ways so it never leans on colour alone: a sign glyph and
a hue together — a leading ``+`` in green for what buyers praise, a
leading ``−`` in red for what they complain about, and no glyph in blue
for the neutral product vocabulary both camps share. The takeaway is
meant to jump out of the raster: the biggest words are *grind* and
*quiet*, so people mostly love how it works, while the largest complaint
word is *noisy*, the one recurring gripe.

This module builds the SVG string by hand — no matplotlib / seaborn /
wordcloud / plotly, and no Vega, because a collision-free
Archimedean-spiral packing of variable-size glyphs is not a native
Vega-Lite mark and is far cleaner authored directly. Placement is fully
offline and deterministic: words are laid biggest-first, each one walked
outward along an Archimedean spiral until its axis-aligned bounding box
clears every word already placed (plus a small breathing margin), so the
finished cloud has **zero overlaps**. The result is a denser, calmer
spiral than the Highcharts / ECharts word clouds it improves on, in the
sprezzature-* house style pulled from :mod:`_style`: the Apple-ish saturated
palette used as three semantic groups, Roboto typography, ink
``#1D1D1F`` on a white background, a takeaway title, and a one-line
subtitle.

The figure is interactive without any JavaScript: hovering or
keyboard-focusing a legend entry lifts its whole theme and dims the
other two, and every word carries a native ``<title>`` tooltip with its
exact review-mention count. Motion is guarded by
``prefers-reduced-motion``.

Running the module writes the SVG artifact to
``sprezzature-figures/assets/svg-examples/wordcloud.svg``.
