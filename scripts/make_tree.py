make_tree — publication-quality tidy node-link tree as a hand-authored SVG.

A tree diagram (org chart / taxonomy) shows a strict parent → child
hierarchy: every node has exactly one parent, and the reader follows
the branching structure from a single root down to the leaves. It
answers "how does this whole break into parts, and how deep does any
branch go?" more directly than an indented list, because the eye reads
depth as horizontal distance and siblings as a vertical stack.

Vega-Lite has no native tidy-tree mark, so this figure is built as an
SVG string by hand rather than through ``vl_convert``. The layout is a
**left-to-right Reingold–Tilford tidy tree**:

* every node sits in a column ("depth") fixed by its distance from the
  root, so all siblings across the tree line up by generation;
* leaves are packed onto evenly-spaced rows, and each internal node is
  centred on the vertical span of its children — the classic tidy
  layout that keeps the tree compact with no crossing edges;
* **links** are smooth horizontal cubic-Bézier curves (diagonal links,
  not elbow/orthogonal) from a parent's right edge to a child's left
  edge, which read cleanly at this fan-out.

House style follows ``_style.py`` / ``bar.vl.json``: Roboto type, the
Apple-system categorical palette, ink ``#1D1D1F`` on white, rounded
node corners, a start-anchored title plus a one-line takeaway subtitle.
Each top-level branch owns a hue, and that hue tints the whole subtree
so the eye can group a family at a glance.

Interaction (no JavaScript): every node carries a native ``<title>``
tooltip, and a CSS ``:hover`` / ``:focus`` rule lifts a node's whole
root-to-node lineage — the ancestor links and node cards brighten while
the rest of the tree dims. That "trace a branch to the root" affordance
is exactly what a hierarchy invites, so ``interactive`` is true. A tidy
tree does not benefit from motion, so ``animated`` is false.

Running the module writes the SVG to
``sprezzature-figures/assets/svg-examples/tree.svg``.
