"""Generate a publication-quality *horizon chart* as a standalone static SVG.

A horizon chart is the space-efficient answer to "show me many dense time
series at once and let me still read each one". It takes the classic filled
area chart and (1) slices the value range into a few equal **bands**, (2)
paints each higher band in a more saturated shade of the same hue and
collapses them onto the same thin row, and (3) **folds** any negative excursion
up as a mirror-image area in a contrasting hue. The result packs the readable
punch of a tall area chart into a strip a few pixels high, so a whole fleet of
series stacks into one screen and outliers pop out by colour weight alone.

This module builds the SVG string **by hand** (no matplotlib / seaborn /
plotly, no Vega): it lays each series into its own banded row, paints the bands
as increasingly saturated house-palette blues (above baseline) and reds
(below), and adds native ``<title>`` hover tooltips — no JavaScript. A horizon
chart is a dense static comparison; motion adds nothing a still cannot already
show, so the whole picture is drawn fully at rest — every band is present the
instant the SVG loads. The colour weight of a row is a redundant channel on top
of vertical position, so the busiest node is obvious at a glance.

The example data is illustrative: hourly CPU utilisation across a small fleet
of database nodes over one day, plotted as the deviation from each node's own
daily mean — the framing horizon charts are made for, where a single saturated
red-then-dark-blue row instantly flags the node that swung hardest.

Usage
-----
    python make_horizon.py                 # writes the house SVG
    python make_horizon.py --out other.svg

Style rules: numpy docstrings, full typing, dict-as-record over ad-hoc
classes, generous comments.
