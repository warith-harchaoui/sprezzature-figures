make_liftgain — a cumulative-gain (lift/gain) chart as hand-authored SVG.

The **cumulative-gain curve** answers a targeting question: if a model
ranks every customer by predicted risk and you work down that list,
what fraction of the true positives have you captured by the time you
have contacted the top X %? Three reference curves make the answer
legible:

* the **random baseline** — a diagonal, where contacting X % of a
  randomly ordered list captures X % of the positives (no targeting);
* the **perfect model** — the theoretical ceiling, where every real
  positive is ranked ahead of every negative, so the curve climbs at
  the steepest possible slope until all positives are captured, then
  flattens;
* the **actual model** — the real ranked list, which lives between the
  two; its *gap above the baseline* is the value the model adds.

The scenario is a churn-prevention campaign with a fixed calling
budget. The takeaway the figure is built to communicate: **calling the
riskiest 20 % of the ranked list reaches ~63 % of the churners** — a
marker sits at that operating point, with dropped guide lines and a
direct call-out stating both the gain and the lift over random. That is
the number a campaign owner budgets against.

This generator builds the SVG by hand (no matplotlib / seaborn / plotly,
no Vega) so the shaded "gain over random" band, the three curves, the
operating-point guides, and the direct curve labels are all under our
control. Curves are distinguished by **more than hue**: the model curve
is a thick solid line with an end-label, the perfect-model envelope is a
thinner solid line labelled at its kink, and the random baseline is a
*dashed* diagonal — so the three read apart under greyscale and
deuteranopia and each is named directly on the plot, not only in a
legend. It matches the sprezzature-* house style: Roboto, the Apple-ish
palette, rounded corners, ink ``#1D1D1F``, secondary ``#6E6E73``, white
background, white keylines.

The operating-point marker carries a native ``<title>`` tooltip and a
:hover / :focus emphasis; no JavaScript beyond the shared fullscreen
control.

The final artifact is always an SVG written to
``sprezzature-figures/assets/svg-examples/liftgain.svg``.

def _simulate_scores(n: int, base_rate: float, seed: int, separation: float = 1.6) -> "np.ndarray":
    """Simulate a ranked churn-risk experiment and return the labels.

    A model assigns each of ``n`` customers a churn-risk score; the
    customers are then sorted from highest to lowest score. This returns
    the true churn labels *in that ranked order* — a 1 where the
    customer actually churned, a 0 otherwise. A useful (but imperfect)
    model concentrates the 1s near the sprezzature of the array.

    The scores come from the standard two-population model used to
    reason about a binary classifier's ranking quality: non-churners and
    churners each draw a Gaussian score, and the churners' distribution
    is shifted up by ``separation`` standard deviations. A larger shift
    means the model separates the classes better; the overlap that
    remains is what keeps the model realistic rather than an oracle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of customers in the base.
    base_rate : float
        Overall churn rate (fraction of customers who churn).

    separation : float, optional
        Gap between the churner and non-churner score means, in standard
        deviations (the model's discriminative skill). Default 1.6,
        tuned so the top-20% cutoff reaches ~3 in 5 churners.

    Returns

        model's highest predicted risk to its lowest.
